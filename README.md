# Design-RISC-V-Processor
 Developed a fully functional 64-bit RISC-V processor based on the RV64I instruction set using Verilog HDL. The processor implements a 5-stage pipeline architecture (Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, Write Back) and supports key instruction formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type) such as ADD, SUB, LW, SW, and BEQ.
